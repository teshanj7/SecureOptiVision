# OptiVisionSPM - Cataract, Glaucoma Detection and Eye Care System 
Repository for the Cataract, Glaucoma Detection and Eye Care System built for Software Project Development (SPM) module of the first semester of the third year in the BSc. in IT degree program at SLIIT.

<h2>Year 3 - Semester 1 SPM Project (2023 - July)</h2>
<p>OptiVision is a fully functional eye care management system that lets patients do a variety of vision related activities such as taking vision tests (quizzes), glaucoma detection, optician appointment scheduling and so on. There will be two types of specific users using this application. They are the patients and the opticians. Doctors (Opticians) are able to check the submitted pictures for cataract detectiom and give a verdict and also prescribe exercies, medicine using the digital prescirption feature to the patients. Patients are also given the do quizzes regarding color blindness, visual distance to check their vision, and they are also able to schedule appointments with their preferred optician. A machine learning model will be used to detect glaucoma when the patient submits a picture of a detailed eye scan and it will detect whether the specific person has glaucoma. </p>
